        This is a fun face and expression detection web app that I have built
        during this pandemic lockdown (special thanks to the bat eaterüòÇüòÇ)
        using face-api.js. I didn‚Äôt realize that this project would be so simple
        to build until I finally built it. Thanks to face-api.js and
        TensorFlow.js that have already done the harder part of implementing
        convolutional neural networks to solve for face detection and
        recognition of faces and face landmarks. <br />
        <br /> Do check out my project. (As it is not fully optimized, it may
        take quite some time to load up). <br />
        <br />I would be more than happy to receive any improvement suggestions
        for my project
